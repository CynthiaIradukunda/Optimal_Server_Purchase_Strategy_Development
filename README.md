## Problem
My case study concerns a communication company that is facing serious internal communication issues. These issues have resulted in missed delivery dates, a loss of market share, and a significant drop in stock value. The problem has been exacerbated by a lack of coordination between the marketing, sales, and manufacturing departments, which has led to production inefficiencies and inventory mismatches, as the companyâ€™s executive has presented. 

To solve this problem, company executive Mr. Gofero proposes installing an internal company-wide computer network to enhance communication across departments. The implementation is planned over five months, with a phased approach to connecting different departments per month, saving the first for staff buy-in and education. 

## Data Used
1. Departments and Employees:

- Sales (50), Manufacturing (180), Warehouse (30), Marketing (70).

2. Server Types and Costs:

- Standard Intel Pentium PC: $2,500 (30 employees).

- Enhanced Intel Pentium PC: $5,000 (80 employees).

- SGI Workstation: $10,000 (200 employees, 10% discount in Months 1-2).

- Sun Workstation: $25,000 (2,000 employees, 25% discount in Months 1-2).

## Methodology and Language
1. Modeling Approach:

- Integer Programming (IP) using Python's PuLP library.

- Defined decision variables, objective functions, and constraints.

2. Optimization Goals:

- Minimize monthly server costs while meeting department needs.

- Minimize total cost over five months, leveraging discounts.

3. Constraints:

- Budget and capacity limits.

- Server allocation for increasing employee needs per month.

## Results
### Approach A: Minimize Monthly Costs:

| Month | Server Purchased | Cost |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---- |
| 2 | 2 Standard PCs | $5,000 |
| 3 | 1 SGI Workstation | $10,000|
| 4 |  No purchase | $0 |
| 5 | 1 Enhanced PC | $5,000 |
| Total | - | $20,000 |

Key Insight: Focused on immediate needs, leading to higher overall costs.

### Approach B: Minimize Total Costs:

| Month | Server Purchased | Cost |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---- |
| 1 | 1 | SGI Workstation | $10,000
| 2 | No purchase | $0 |
| 3 | 1 SGI Workstation | $9,000 |
| 4 | No purchase | $0 |
| 5 | No purchase | $0 |
| Total | - | $19,000|

Key Insight: Strategic early purchases optimized costs through discounts.

### Comparison Table:

| Approach | Total Cost | Key Purchases | Discounts Utilized |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| A | $20,000 | Multiple small servers monthly | Limited |
| B | $19,000 | Early larger servers | Fully leveraged |

## Recommendation

For long-term cost savings and early discounts utilization, I recommend the company to opt for the second Approach (Approach B). Doing this will also help it account for operational costs, training, and potential future growth during implementation.
